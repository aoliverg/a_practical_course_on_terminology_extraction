# Spacy English Tagger

## 1. Introduction

This is a simple tagger able to POS tag text files (it is recommended that the text file are segmented). It uses Spacy and the Spacy model en_core_web_sm. The model should be located in the sambe folder as the program.

The Python version is distributed. You can download to a Windows executable version from http://lpg.uoc.edu/a_practical_course_on_terminology_extraction/SpacyEnglishTagger.zip 

Download and unzip it and it is ready to use.

If you use the Python version you need a Python v3 interpreter installed in your computer (https://www.python.org/) and you need to install the following prerequisites:

```sudo pip3 install PyYAML spacy```
